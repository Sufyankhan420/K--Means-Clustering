# K--Means-Clustering
# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
This repository demonstrates customer segmentation for a retail store using the K-means clustering algorithm. By grouping customers based on their purchase history and demographic data, the project aims to help businesses better understand customer behavior and enhance targeted marketing efforts.

# Project Overview
Customer segmentation is crucial for tailoring marketing strategies to specific customer groups. In this project, we use the K-means algorithm to identify customer segments based on features such as Annual Income, Spending Score, and Gender. The segmentation helps uncover patterns and trends in customer spending habits.

# Features Used for Clustering
Gender: Categorical feature (converted to numerical for clustering).
Annual Income (k$): Continuous feature representing customers' yearly income.
Spending Score (1-100): Continuous feature indicating spending behavior, where higher scores imply higher spending.
Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing

# Checked for missing values.
Converted categorical data to numeric values for consistency.
Scaled data using StandardScaler to normalize features and improve clustering performance.
Determining Optimal Clusters

# Used the Elbow Method to find the ideal number of clusters by plotting Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) against various values of K.
K-means Clustering

# Performed clustering on scaled data and analyzed clusters to understand the characteristics of each segment.
Visualization

# Visualized clusters using scatter plots to identify distinct customer segments based on income and spending behavior.
Requirements
# To run this project, install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn threadpoolctl
Getting Started
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation-kmeans.git
Load the Data
 Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python
Place your dataset file (Mall_Customers.csv) in the appropriate directory.

# Run the Script
Execute the script to view the customer segments:

bash
Copy code
python customer_segmentation.py
Usage
This script reads customer data, preprocesses it, clusters customers using K-means, and visualizes the results.
By adjusting the number of clusters, businesses can explore different segmentations.
Results
After clustering, the data is segmented into distinct groups, with each cluster representing a specific type of customer. These insights can assist in tailoring marketing strategies to different customer segments.
